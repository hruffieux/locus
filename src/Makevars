## With Rcpp 0.11.0 and later, we no longer need to set PKG_LIBS as there is
## no user-facing library. The include path to headers is already set by R.

## strips debug symbols (smaller .so size)
PKG_LIBS = -Wl,-S

## With R 3.1.0 or later, you can uncomment the following line to tell R to
## enable compilation with C++11 (or even C++14) where available
#CXX_STD = CXX11
