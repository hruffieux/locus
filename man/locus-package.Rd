\title{locus: a package for combined predictor and outcome selection in
high-dimensional set-ups using variational inference}
\description{
The locus package provides an efficient variational algorithm for
simultaneous variable selection of predictors and associated outcomes based
on a sparse multivariate regression model (H. Ruffieux, A. C. Davison,
J. Hager, I. Irincheeva, Efficient inference for genetic association studies
with multiple outcomes, Biostatistics, 2017). The methods from this package
have been used on large genetic datasets from molecular quantitative trait
locus (QTL) problems with over 200K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
hundreds of molecular expression levels and hundreds of samples.
